## General Information
- This weather application was built using React as well as the Open Weather API.
- You can use this application to check the weather of any major city with a population over 100,000.
- The purpose of the project was for me to practice working with an API in React.
- I undertook this project to better my understanding of APIs, how they work, and how to work with them.


## Technologies Used
- React
- Open Weather API

## Setup
To run this app locally, use `npm i` to install all dependencies, and then `npm run start` to run the server locally.


## Usage
Once the application is running in your browser, simply type in the name of the city you want to check the weather in.

## Project Status
Project is: Complete.


## Room for Improvement

Room for improvement:
- I could have worked better on the front-end side of things, but that wasn't the purpose of this project.
